# Database Migrations ðŸ”—
The scripts in this directory are stored purely for the sake of archiving them. 
They are one-off programs that alter the general shape of a certain part of the database. 
Migrations are rare, since I usually try to model the collections and documents in a way that allows for extended flexibility.

## Naming guidelines:
- `yyyy-mm-dd_` - the start of the script's name is the date the migration was performed (Not the date the script itself was written)
- `the_topic.py` - the end is a general, short description of the task performed. Look through the directory to get a grasp of what I mean
