# Privacy Policy
## 1. Why and how we collect and use your information
GitBot mainly provides an automated application for chat and social platforms, (the "Service") and is operated by The GitBot Team (the "Team", "we", "us", "Statch)  
for users of the Service (“you”, "your). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from users of the Service.  
Under applicable law, The GitBot Team is the "data controller" of personal data collected throughout your usage of the Service.  
Our collection and use of your information is mandated to provide the Service and ensure the best possible user experience.

## 2. The information we collect and store
By design, the only Discord-related information we collect is your Discord user ID, the ID of the server you are using GitBot in, and, optionally, webhook secrets if you use features that require them.
The rest of the data is GitBot-specific and does not use information correlated with your Discord account.   
(i) Your Discord user ID and related information:  
(i.a) Your "quick-access" repositories, users, and organizations  
(i.b) Your preferred language's ISO-2 code

(ii.a) "Release feeds" (GitHub repository names, last releases, configured mentions, and *webhook secrets*) associated with the server  
(ii.b) "Autoconv" (Automatic Conversion) settings for the server, set by users with appropriate permissions.

## 3. Information shared with third parties
We share limited information about your Discord profile with third parties to help us provide the Service.  The parties in question are:
(i) The GitHub API, which is used to provide the Service;  
(ii) Statcord, used to monitor and track usage of the Service;

## 4. Where we store your information
The Team itself doesn't operate solely on one country's premises, but the entire infrastructure is contained within Europe.
The secure database used by the Service is hosted in a MongoDB Inc.-operated datacenter in Frankfurt, Germany.

## 5. How we use your information
We use your information to:  
(i) Provide the Service;  
(ii) Provide technical support;  
(iii) Improve and maintain the Service;  
(iv) Deliver a developer-focused productivity tool;

## 6. How long we retain your information
We retain your information for as long as you are an active user of the Service and haven't requested the deletion of your data.

## 7. How we protect your information
We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
Nobody can see your information except for authorized members of the Team.

## 8. Viewing your data and deleting it
You can request to delete/view your data at any time by contacting us at [privacy@statch.org](mailto:privacy@statch.org) with information necessary to identify your information (typically your Discord user ID).
If you wish to manage a server's data, you can request to delete/view it only if you're the owner or a server administrator.

## Final
